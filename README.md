Fully automated- 800 eCommerce drop shipment listings via eBay and Bonanza

*This APP is not fully uploaded here on GitHub.*<br>
I've uploaded a small example module that I used for scraping images, descriptions, available inventory quantity and prices for items sold online by TJ Maxx. These were autonomously uploaded via node.js, Google's Puppeteer, arrays saved as CSV files and Microsoft Excell to both the eBay and Bonanza selling platforms. Because products were autonomously found and listed by the app, I was selling nearly 1k products without actually knowing what they are or what I had listed on eBay and Bonanza. A standard profit of 15% was set for every listing. A cap of 800 simultaneous sales was set because that's how much information my computer at the time could process without timing out.<br><br>
Total sales to date on eBay are above $60k of products that I never owned in the first place, that sales number does not include Bonanza sales. <br><br>

This dropshipment application is no longer maintained as I make good, easy money through my job at AA. I often consider spinning AutonomousSellerBot up again for passive income but... whatever.<br><br>
Here is a link to my eBay reviews as proof.<br>
