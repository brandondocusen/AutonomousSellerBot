# AutonomousSellerBot
Fully automated- 800 eCommerce drop shipment listings, inventory maintenance and price adjusting via eBay and Bonanza.


*This APP is not fully uploaded here on GitHub.*<br>
I've uploaded a small example module that I used for scraping images, descriptions, available inventory quantity and prices for items sold online by TJ Maxx. However products from Walmart, Kohls, JC Penny, 6pm and just about any other retailer you can think of were scraped and sold on my eComm pages.<br><br>
These were autonomously uploaded via node.js, Google's Puppeteer (JavaScript), arrays saved as CSV files and Microsoft Excell to both the eBay and Bonanza selling platforms. Dynamic pricing and inventory changes were also automatically managed using Javscript conditionals. Because products were autonomously found and listed by the app, I was selling nearly 1k products without actually knowing what they are or what I had listed on eBay and Bonanza. A standard profit of 15% was set for every listing. A cap of 800 simultaneous sales was set because that's how much information my computer at the time could process without timing out.<br><br>
Total sales to date on eBay are above $60k of products that I never owned in the first place, that sales number does not include Bonanza sales. <br><br>

This dropshipment application is no longer maintained as I make good, easy money through my job at AA. I often consider spinning AutonomousSellerBot up again for passive income but... whatever. The most important impact this had on my life was when I had to have a major surgery and was out of work for 2 months. This app was sufficient as my only source of income.<br><br>
Here is a link to my eBay reviews as proof of deployment.<br>
