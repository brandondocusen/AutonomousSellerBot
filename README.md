Fully automated- 800 eCommerce drop shipment listings via eBay and Bonanza

*This APP is not fully uploaded here on GitHub.*<br>
I've uploaded a small example module that I used for scraping images, descriptions, available inventory quantity and prices for items sold online by TJ Maxx. These were autonomously uploaded via node.js, Google's Puppeteer, CSV files and Microsoft Excell to both the eBay and Bonanza selling platforms.<br>
Total sales to date on eBay are above $60k of products that I never owned in the first place. <br><br>

This dropshipment application is no longer maintained as I make good, easy money though my job at AA. I often consider spinning it up again for passive income but... whatever.<br><br>
Here is a link to my eBay reviews as proof.<br>
